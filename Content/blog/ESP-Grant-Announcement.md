# Open Labels Initiative Secures Ethereum Foundation ESP Grant to Accelerate Open Data Layer for Web3

The Open Labels Initiative (OLI) is proud to announce it has secured a grant from the Ethereum Foundation Ecosystem Support Program (ESP). This crucial funding will accelerate OLI's mission to build an open, decentralized, and community-driven data layer for smart contract labels, addressing the critical need for a unified source of on-chain context in the Ethereum ecosystem and beyond.

## The Problem OLI Solves: Fragmented Knowledge in a Transparent World

Blockchains are inherently transparent, yet understanding the activity within them remains fragmented and opaque. This paradox stems from the prevalence of proprietary, siloed datasets for smart contract labels. Multiple teams are independently building and maintaining their own closed labeling systems, leading to duplicated efforts, inconsistent data, and a lack of universal understanding. This creates a hidden "tax" on Web3 development, security, and user experience.

OLI emerged from this challenge, recognizing that the only sustainable path forward is a crowdsourced, open standard. Our vision is to transform smart contract and address labels into a shared public goodâ€”accessible to all, maintained by the community, and not locked behind paywalls.

## OLI's Traction and Impact So Far

Since its inception, OLI has made significant strides, demonstrating strong community engagement and initial integrations:

*   **Robust Web Platform:** We've developed an intuitive attestation hub with features like bulk CSV upload, interactive analytics showcasing over 68,000 high-quality attestations, and project addition tools using OSS-directory.
*   **Active Development:** Our GitHub repository shows consistent growth with regular updates to core labeling frameworks and the implementation of Python and TypeScript SDKs, including a recently released `oli-python` pip package for easy integration.
*   **Growing Community:** We maintain active connections with contributors from projects like Sourcify, Routscan, Coinbase, MetaMask, ENS and Bundlebear, fostering a collaborative environment through monthly community calls.
*   **Key Integrations:** OLI labels are already being utilized by platforms such as Sourcify's explorer, Agnostic's `agx.app`, and Growthepie, and many more being developed right now, validating the immediate utility of our open data.

## Driving Towards a More Transparent Future with ESP Support

This ESP grant will enable OLI to deliver key enhancements and significantly increase adoption. Our focused deliverables include:

*   **Enhanced Tooling for OLI (Milestone 1):** We will develop and implement more automated labeling scripts to increase the coverage and accuracy of address labels, aiming for over double the corrent number of attestations. We will also develop the first version of simple trust algorithms (Transitive Trust, and whitelisting) to assess label reliability and improve website analytics to showcase label quality and coverage.
*   **Increased Adoption and Onboarding (Milestone 2):** We will actively engage with data teams, blockchain explorers, wallet providers, and application builders to encourage OLI adoption. This includes maintaining active conversation building close relationship with potential partners as updated in our [call for partnership docs](https://github.com/openlabelsinitiative/OLI/blob/main/PARTNERSHIPS.md), and ultimately aiming for integration with at least one major label consumer/provider (e.g., Dune, Coinbase, MetaMask, Blockscout, Sourcify).



## Join the Open Labels Movement

OLI is a public good, and its strength comes from its community. We invite developers, data analysts, security researchers, and anyone passionate about a more transparent Web3 to join us.

*   **Contribute Labels:** Utilize our [Attestation Hub](https://www.openlabelsinitiative.org/attest) or SDKs to contribute valuable contract labels.
*   **Integrate OLI:** Explore our [documentation](https://github.com/openlabelsinitiative/OLI/tree/main) to integrate OLI labels into your dApps, wallets, or analytics platforms.
*   **Join the Conversation:** Participate in our [monthly community calls](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/3?cid=MmQ0MzYxNzQ3ZGFiY2M3ZDJkZjk0NjZiYmY3MmNmZDUwZTNjMjE2OTQ4YzgyNmI4OTBmYjYyN2VmNGRjNjQ4OABncm91cC5jYWxlbm9hcn.google.com) and [Telegram group](https://t.me/olilabels).

With the support of the Ethereum Foundation ESP, OLI is poised to become an indispensable layer of Web3 infrastructure, driving greater security, usability, and decentralized understanding for the entire ecosystem.
